# GitHub Recommender for Beginners

Welcome to my GitHub Recommender for Beginners project! This tool is designed to assist newcomers in discovering GitHub repositories that are both popular and beginner-friendly.

## Overview

Originally conceived as a general GitHub Recommender, I realized the need for a more tailored approach for beginners. While GitHub is abundant with high-star repositories, they can be overwhelming and complex for newcomers. My mission is to provide a platform that ranks repositories from a beginner's perspective, focusing on learning-friendliness, thorough documentation, active community support, beginner-oriented content, and personalized recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Learning-Friendly Scoring:** I use a unique scoring system to evaluate repositories on their beginner-friendliness.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** I prioritize repositories with beginner-oriented documentation.
- **Active Community Support:** I identify repositories with active discussions and community engagement.
- **Beginner-Friendly Content:** I look for repositories offering tutorials, guides, or resources for newcomers.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** I provide recommendations based on coding interests and level.

This tool is here to help both programming novices and those seeking beginner-friendly open-source projects. Join me in making GitHub more accessible to newcomers.

### The Challenge

My initial goal was to create a tool for suggesting repositories based on various factors. However, the real challenge was catering to beginners, who are just starting their coding journey or exploring new technologies.

### Bridging the Gap

For newcomers, GitHub can be like a labyrinth. This tool aims to match beginners with repositories they can genuinely understand and learn from, curating a list tailored to specific learning needs.

### How It Works

I employ a learning-friendly scoring system, considering factors like comprehensive documentation and the presence of beginner-friendly content, to recommend accessible repositories.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
